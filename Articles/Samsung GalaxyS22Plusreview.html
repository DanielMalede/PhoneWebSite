        <h1>SAMSUNG’S GALAXY S22 AND S22 PLUS ARE THE DEFAULT ANDROID PHONES TO BUY</h1>
        <p>The Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus is the high-end Android phone most shoppers in the US should buy in 2022. The
            Plus, and the smaller-but-similar standard S22, aren’t perfect. Battery life, for one, is a weak point, and
            that’s something to consider seriously. There are better options if you’re looking for something a little
            more stylish or with a few more bells and whistles. But the vast majority of people who are just looking for
            a fast, reliable Android device to hold on to for the next few years need to look no further than the S22
            duo.
            <br><br>
        <p> They’re also two of a precious few options we have Stateside, which makes this recommendation sound like a
            backhanded compliment. But they also happen to be really good phones capable of handling just about any task
            you can throw at them, with top-notch cameras and the best support policy you can get for an Android phone
            on this continent. </p>
        <br><br>
        Here’s the bad news: if they’ve been listening to the hype, they’re going to be disappointed. We’ve been
        promised a fourth industrial revolution with fantastical things like remote surgery and driverless cars.
        Instead, what we have now is widespread 5G that’s more or less the same speed as (or even slower than) 4G
        and super-fast mmWave 5G in some parts of some major cities with highly limited range. So where is this 5G
        future we’ve been promised? The truth is that it’s coming along, but it will materialize more slowly and in
        less obvious ways than what we’ve been led to believe.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>It’s also worth stressing that these are iterative updates to the S21. There are some welcome improvements to
            the camera capabilities, the latest Qualcomm chipset, and… that’s kind of it. They’re nice upgrades but
            nothing that should compel an S21 owner to trade in their current phone.</p>
        <div id="s22image1"></div>
        <h1><b><ins><i>SPECTRUM WARS </i></ins></b></h1>
        <p>heThe S22 and S22 Plus offer flat displays with modest bezels and slightly curved rails. The glass back panel
            has returned after the S21’s stint with a “glasstic” rear, and both phones are IP68 rated. The whole thing
            feels solid, understated, and a little fancy. Last year’s design was a little bolder, with metal camera
            bumps blending seamlessly into the rails, but I like this toned-down approach. I’m also a fan of the
            handsome green color option, which I didn’t expect to like so much.
            <br><br>

            The S22 Plus has a bigger 6.6-inch screen, while the S22 feels downright petite in comparison with its
            6.1-inch display. (Don’t read that as the S22 being “small,” but it’s about as small as you can get in the
            Android world at this point.) Both are 1080p OLED screens with up to 120Hz refresh rate, but the S22 Plus’
            features a peak outdoor brightness of 1750 nits versus the S22’s 1300 nits. Both are bright enough to use
            comfortably in direct sunlight.
            <br><br>
            In any conditions, they’re very good screens. The fast refresh rate makes the experience of using the phone
            to scroll through social media and flip through menu screens smooth and polished. Samsung knows how to make
            a good OLED, with rich blacks and vivid colors, and it has outfitted both phones with such a display.
            <br><br>
            I’m less positive on battery life. When I tested the S22 Ultra, the battery drained faster than I expected,
            though I was able to get through even a day of heavy use. The S22 and S22 Plus seem to draw power even
            faster. The little S22 also gets a smaller 3,700mAh battery versus the Plus model’s 4,500mAh cell.

            I saw the S22 battery take an alarming plunge from 30 percent to 20 percent over half an hour of downloading
            apps and logging into accounts, and in a day of typical use, the S22 was down to 58 percent by 3PM. That’s
            without even really trying to push the battery in any challenging way, like streaming video or playing a
            game. Downloading and playing Genshin Impact for about 30 minutes brought that percentage right down to the
            low single digits. The S22 Plus doesn’t fare much better. Though it has a bigger battery, there’s also a
            bigger screen to power, so stamina feels about the same.
            <br><br>
            If seeing a number lower than 20 percent on your battery level indicator makes you break out in hives, then
            the S22 may not be for you. Generally speaking, both the S22 and S22 Plus will get through a day of use, but
            even a moderate user might be coasting on fumes at the end of the day. Gaming takes a big toll on the
            already-shaky battery life, too, making a midday recharge or a backup battery a necessity.
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <div id="s22image2"></div>
        <br><br>
        <p>The better news is that both phones support fast charging: 45W in the S22 Plus and 25W for the S22. The S22
            Plus charges from 0 to 100 percent in just over an hour with Samsung’s 45W charger (sold separately). Both
            support 15W wireless charging, and no matter how you plan to power up the phone, you’ll need to bring your
            own adapter because you won’t find a charger of any kind in the box.
            <br><br>
            The S22 and S22 Plus use the Snapdragon 8 gen 1 chipset in the US, which is Qualcomm’s latest and greatest
            processor for Android phones. Both devices come with 8GB of RAM, and performance overall is excellent. If I
            really push it, I can spot a slight stutter occasionally jumping quickly between apps. But in daily use, I
            don’t see any lag that would bother me.
            <br><br>
            I did notice the S22 getting surprisingly warm with moderate tasks that I wouldn’t expect to be taxing on
            the processor, but if there was any performance throttling as a result, I couldn’t see it. The standard S22
            runs Genshin Impact well, with some slight stuttering here and there. After playing for 30 minutes, the
            phone was very warm, though not uncomfortable to hold, and I couldn’t see any difference in performance.

        <br><br>
        <p>heThe networks might not be firing on all cylinders yet, but more and more mobile devices are ready for them.
            In fact, by the end of the year, it may be harder to find a non-5G phone than one that supports the
            technology. Not only do Apple and Samsung’s flagship phones support 5G across their lineups, but it’s also
            making its way into more midrange and budget devices, thanks to new 5G-ready low-end processors like the
            Qualcomm Snapdragon 480.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>More people than ever will buy a 5G phone this year — likely not because they really wanted 5G, but because
            the phone they were going to get anyway supports it. The good news is that there really isn’t a downside to
            buying a 5G phone now if it’s time to upgrade. The “5G tax” that put a higher price tag on 5G phones over
            the past couple of years seems to be disappearing, and we haven’t noticed any other drawbacks like excessive
            battery drain in our testing.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>So what’s the reaction like so far from, say, someone who bought an iPhone 12 — not for 5G, but because it’s
            the new iPhone? “They’re frustrated and angry,” says Segan. “With both Verizon and AT&T, because of what
            I’ll call technical difficulties, their nationwide 5G is often slower than their 4G. So people are getting
            these iPhones and they’re finding that frequently they have worse performance than they had before 5G.” The
            “technical difficulties” he refers to include DSS in Verizon’s case and the limitations of the narrow 5MHz
            band that AT&T often uses for its 5G.
            <br><br>
            That’s not great. But a couple of factors will make a difference over the next year. First, that C-band
            spectrum will start coming online around the end of the year. If you’re one of the frustrated owners of an
            iPhone 12 or Galaxy S21, there’s good news: your phone is already approved to use C-band, so if you’re on
            Verizon or AT&T, you should see speed improvements when that happens Not all 5G phones support C-band,
            though. Those that don’t will need a software update to use it, and there’s no guarantee that your phone’s
            manufacturer will offer one. Inexpensive 5G models, in particular, may not see a C-band update, even if they
            have the hardware to support it. Phone makers need to apply for Federal Communications Commission approval
            to enable it and may be less likely to bother with the cost of this step for phones with a shorter lifespan.
            <br><br>
            The other factor is something that will likely happen sooner than C-band becoming available: large
            gatherings. That’s when Segan thinks Verizon’s Ultra Wideband could really shine. “When we’re all
            vaccinated, I think people are going to be desperate... for all of these dense, crowded, communal
            experiences that we will have been missing for a year and a half. And so Verizon should be working on
            applications and experiences right now like the thing they did at the Super Bowl, or what they’ve talked
            about doing at Disney World, that you can only do on Ultra Wideband.”
            <br><br>
            Again, that will depend on your 5G phone supporting the right kind of 5G — not every 5G phone supports
            mmWave. The aforementioned iPhone and Samsung flagships do, and other Verizon models that support are
            denoted as “UW.”.
        </p>
        <h1><b><ins><i>WHERE ARE OUR JETPACKS? </i></ins></b></h1>
        <p>ndAnd what about the stuff of CES keynotes like remote surgery and self-driving cars? That’s on the way, too,
            but it’ll take longer. Thelander explains: “The first focus of 5G was really a feature called ‘enhanced
            mobile broadband’ and that’s just getting fast data speeds to the consumer on their smartphone. Things like
            factory automation and the functionality behind that, that was really developed afterwards, so it lags, from
            a standardization perspective.”
            Getting the technology piece sorted out is only half of the equation. “Once you’ve got a certain feature or
            functionality defined in a standard, now a vendor has to go out and build that functionality, then you have
            to test it, and then you have to have the industry adopt it,” Thelander says. “The technology may be there,
            the standard may be there, it may work fine, but it has to be implemented and rolled out. And you have to
            have the business case for it. How do you make money off of it? All those types of things… it just takes
            time.”
            <br><br>
            Despite networks constantly waving their “5G Mission Accomplished” banners in TV commercials over the past
            year, 5G is very much still a work in progress. It’s going to get better, but how soon that happens for you
            depends on a lot of factors: which phone you have and what bands it supports, which network you’re on, where
            you are, and what you’re doing. It seems clear now that there never really was a “Race to 5G” — just
            technological progress as usual, which is often slow, confusing, and uneven. That’s a little bit harder to
            sell in a keynote or a commercial.
