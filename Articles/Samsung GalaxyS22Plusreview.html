        <h1>SAMSUNG’S GALAXY S22 AND S22 PLUS ARE THE DEFAULT ANDROID PHONES TO BUY</h1>
        <p>
            The Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus is the high-end Android phone most shoppers in the US should buy in 2022. The
            Plus, and the smaller-but-similar standard S22, aren’t perfect. Battery life, for one, is a weak point, and
            that’s something to consider seriously. There are better options if you’re looking for something a little
            more stylish or with a few more bells and whistles. But the vast majority of people who are just looking for
            a fast, reliable Android device to hold on to for the next few years need to look no further than the S22
            duo.
            <br><br>
            They’re also two of a precious few options we have Stateside, which makes this recommendation sound like a
            backhanded compliment. But they also happen to be really good phones capable of handling just about any task
            you can throw at them, with top-notch cameras and the best support policy you can get for an Android phone
            on this continent.
            <br><br>
            Here’s the bad news: if they’ve been listening to the hype, they’re going to be disappointed. We’ve been
            promised a fourth industrial revolution with fantastical things like remote surgery and driverless cars.
            Instead, what we have now is widespread 5G that’s more or less the same speed as (or even slower than) 4G
            and super-fast mmWave 5G in some parts of some major cities with highly limited range. So where is this 5G
            future we’ve been promised? The truth is that it’s coming along, but it will materialize more slowly and in
            less obvious ways than what we’ve been led to believe.
            <br><br>
            It’s also worth stressing that these are iterative updates to the S21. There are some welcome improvements
            to
            the camera capabilities, the latest Qualcomm chipset, and… that’s kind of it. They’re nice upgrades but
            nothing that should compel an S21 owner to trade in their current phone.
            <br><br>
        <div class="text-center">

        <br><br>
        heThe S22 and S22 Plus offer flat displays with modest bezels and slightly curved rails. The glass back panel
        has returned after the S21’s stint with a “glasstic” rear, and both phones are IP68 rated. The whole thing
        feels solid, understated, and a little fancy. Last year’s design was a little bolder, with metal camera
        bumps blending seamlessly into the rails, but I like this toned-down approach. I’m also a fan of the
        handsome green color option, which I didn’t expect to like so much.
        <br><br>

        The S22 Plus has a bigger 6.6-inch screen, while the S22 feels downright petite in comparison with its
        6.1-inch display. (Don’t read that as the S22 being “small,” but it’s about as small as you can get in the
        Android world at this point.) Both are 1080p OLED screens with up to 120Hz refresh rate, but the S22 Plus’
        features a peak outdoor brightness of 1750 nits versus the S22’s 1300 nits. Both are bright enough to use
        comfortably in direct sunlight.
        <br><br>
        In any conditions, they’re very good screens. The fast refresh rate makes the experience of using the phone
        to scroll through social media and flip through menu screens smooth and polished. Samsung knows how to make
        a good OLED, with rich blacks and vivid colors, and it has outfitted both phones with such a display.
        <br><br>
        I’m less positive on battery life. When I tested the S22 Ultra, the battery drained faster than I expected,
        though I was able to get through even a day of heavy use. The S22 and S22 Plus seem to draw power even
        faster. The little S22 also gets a smaller 3,700mAh battery versus the Plus model’s 4,500mAh cell.

        I saw the S22 battery take an alarming plunge from 30 percent to 20 percent over half an hour of downloading
        apps and logging into accounts, and in a day of typical use, the S22 was down to 58 percent by 3PM. That’s
        without even really trying to push the battery in any challenging way, like streaming video or playing a
        game. Downloading and playing Genshin Impact for about 30 minutes brought that percentage right down to the
        low single digits. The S22 Plus doesn’t fare much better. Though it has a bigger battery, there’s also a
        bigger screen to power, so stamina feels about the same.
        <br><br>
        If seeing a number lower than 20 percent on your battery level indicator makes you break out in hives, then
        the S22 may not be for you. Generally speaking, both the S22 and S22 Plus will get through a day of use, but
        even a moderate user might be coasting on fumes at the end of the day. Gaming takes a big toll on the
        already-shaky battery life, too, making a midday recharge or a backup battery a necessity.
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        The better news is that both phones support fast charging: 45W in the S22 Plus and 25W for the S22. The S22
        Plus charges from 0 to 100 percent in just over an hour with Samsung’s 45W charger (sold separately). Both
        support 15W wireless charging, and no matter how you plan to power up the phone, you’ll need to bring your
        own adapter because you won’t find a charger of any kind in the box.
        <br><br>
        The S22 and S22 Plus use the Snapdragon 8 gen 1 chipset in the US, which is Qualcomm’s latest and greatest
        processor for Android phones. Both devices come with 8GB of RAM, and performance overall is excellent. If I
        really push it, I can spot a slight stutter occasionally jumping quickly between apps. But in daily use, I
        don’t see any lag that would bother me.
        <br><br>
        I did notice the S22 getting surprisingly warm with moderate tasks that I wouldn’t expect to be taxing on
        the processor, but if there was any performance throttling as a result, I couldn’t see it. The standard S22
        runs Genshin Impact well, with some slight stuttering here and there. After playing for 30 minutes, the
        phone was very warm, though not uncomfortable to hold, and I couldn’t see any difference in performance.

        heThe S22 and S22 Plus ship with One UI 4.1, which adds some nice customization options to the interface.
        You can’t take it quite as far as with the Pixel 6, but you can choose a color palette based on your phone
        wallpaper and apply it to system controls and app icons. I like the colors it suggested for me, and the
        overall effect does make it feel more personal.
        <br><br>
        During setup, you can opt out of adding Samsung’s many proprietary apps to your home screen, which helps
        tame the clutter the company’s software can sometimes tend toward. Samsung has also mercifully removed the
        ads that once sullied the top of the weather app. But then there are the hallmarks of a Samsung phone, like
        having two app stores and two digital assistants and sometimes seeing a Samsung Pay offer slide across your
        screen when you’re just trying to open up Hulu and doom-watch Handmaid’s Tale. Samsung gonna Samsung.
        <br><br>
        In any case, Samsung offers one of the best support policies among Android device makers and says the S22
        series will get “up to” four generations of Android OS updates. That’s one year better than even Google
        promises for its devices. It’s a great policy, and the company seems to be speeding up the rate at which it
        provides OS version upgrades, which we truly love to see.

        The S22 and S22 Plus feature a 50-megapixel f/1.8 main camera with stabilization, a 10-megapixel
        stabilized 3x telephoto, a 12-megapixel ultrawide, and a 10-megapixel selfie camera. Samsung’s 10x optical
        zoom and giant 108-megapixel sensors are reserved for the Ultra. Video specs are on par with last year: up
        to 8K / 24p recording from the main camera, and 4K at 30 or 60p from the front-facing camera. There’s not a
        whole lot that’s new and exciting about the hardware — this year’s camera improvements are mostly
        software-based, and they’re subtle but worthwhile.
        <br><br>
        Portrait mode is better this time, with improved subject detection that can isolate even smaller fine
        details like strands of hair. Wide-angle portraits still have a bit of a cardboard cutout look to them, but
        portraits with the 3x zoom look darn good. Subject detection still gets tripped up on things like beards,
        and you do have to look close to see the improvements compared to the S21’s portrait mode. It’s not
        something to go out and buy this phone for, but it’s a nice update that takes portrait mode ever closer to
        looking like the real deal.
        <br><br>
        The Expert RAW app that debuted on the Galaxy S21 Ultra in beta is now fully launched and available for all
        three S22 phones. This app, which must be downloaded from the Galaxy Store, allows you to capture
        computational RAW files that combine data from multiple frames into one flexible DNG file. The resulting RAW
        image is less noisy than a traditional single-frame RAW file, with more data available for post-processing.
        Apple has offered a version of this called ProRAW for a couple of years, and it’s great to see Samsung
        getting on board, too.
        <br><br>
        The S22 and S22 Plus can combine their full 50-megapixel high-res shooting mode with night mode, which could
        only be used separately in the past. This can’t be triggered manually; you’ll need to be shooting in
        high-res mode in really dark conditions, and then you’ll see a little moon icon appear, enabling the
        feature. The result is an image with a bit better detail and color than if you’d shot it without night mode
        enabled. It’s nice and could be useful for night landscape photos, but it’s a relatively niche feature.
        <br><br>
        The same conditions apply to portrait mode photos, too. If you’re taking a portrait mode photo with the
        front or rear cameras in very low light, a night mode option will appear. It’s only really useful if your
        subject is very still, and isn’t, for example, a pet or a squirming baby. Night selfie portraits are also
        fairly unflattering, so I didn’t find them to be a useful addition.
        <br><br>
        The night photography additions aren’t particularly impressive, but in any case, the S22 has a very good
        camera system. A lot of it has been carried over from the previous generation, but that’s not a bad thing —
        it was a good system in the S21, too. It’s one I feel like I can trust. The 3x telephoto is reliable, and
        images look good even in dim lighting. Portrait mode photos in bright lighting, especially from the
        telephoto, are among the best I’ve seen from a smartphone. You can still spot some of Samsung’s trademark
        over-saturated colors here and there (neon blue skies are a favorite). But overall, the S22 and S22 Plus
        produced quality photos that I’m happy to put on social media or the grandparents’ digital picture frame.
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        The S22 and S22 Plus will more than satisfy the needs of most mainstream users who want a high-end slab-style
        Android phone that will get them through their daily tasks reliably. They’re fast, well-built, and include
        high-end features like bright 120Hz displays and a good 3x telephoto camera.
